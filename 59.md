Gift Wrap
---------

`draft` `optional` `author:vitorpamplona` `author:kieran` `author:paulmillr` `author:staab`

This NIP defines a protocol for encapsulating any nostr event. This makes it possible to obscure almost all metadata for a given event, perform collaborative signing, and more.

This NIP relies on [NIP-44](44.md)'s versioned encryption algorithms.

# Overview

This protocol uses three main concepts to protect the transmission of a target event: `rumor`s, `seal`s, and `gift wrap`s.

- A `rumor` is a regular nostr event, but is **not signed**. This means that if it is leaked, it cannot be verified.
- A `rumor` is serialized to JSON, encrypted, and placed in the `content` field of a `seal`. The `seal` is then signed by the author of the note. The only information publicly available on a `seal` is who signed it, but not what was said.
- A `seal` is serialized to JSON, encrypted, and placed in the `content` field of a `gift wrap`.

This allows the isolation of concerns across layers:

- A rumor carries the content but is unsigned, which means if leaked it will be rejected by relays and clients, and can't be authenticated.
- A seal identifies the author without revealing the content or the recipient.
- A gift wrap can add metadata (recipient, tags, a different author) without revealing the true author.

# Protocol Description

## 1. The Rumor Event Kind

A `rumor` is the same thing as an unsigned event. Any event kind can be made a `rumor` by removing the signature.

## 2. The Seal Event Kind

A `seal` is a `kind:13` event that wraps a `rumor` with the sender's regular key. The `seal` is **always** encrypted to a receiver's pubkey but there is no `p` tag pointing to the receiver. There is no way to know who the rumor is for without the receiver's or the sender's private key. The only public information in this event is who is signing it.

```js
{
  "id": "<id>",
  "pubkey": "<real author's pubkey>",
  "content": "<encrypted rumor>",
  "kind": 13,
  "created_at": 1686840217,
  "tags": [],
  "sig": "<real author's pubkey signature>"
}
```

Tags MUST must always be empty in a `kind:13`. The inner event MUST always be unsigned.

## 3. Gift Wrap Event Kind

A `gift wrap` event is a `kind:1059` event that wraps any other event. `tags` MUST include a single `p` tag containing the recipient's public key.

The goal is to hide the sender's information, the metadata, and the content of the original event from the public. The only public information is the receiver's public key.

```js
{
  "id": "<id>",
  "pubkey": "<random, one-time-use pubkey>",
  "content": "<encrypted kind 13>",
  "kind": 1059,
  "created_at": 1686840217,
  "tags": [["p", "<Receiver>"]],
  "sig": "<random, one-time-use pubkey signature>"
}
```

# Encrypting Payloads

Encryption is done following NIP-44 on the JSON-encoded event. Place the the encryption payload in the `.content` of the wrapper event (either a `seal` or a `gift wrap`).

# Other Considerations

If a `rumor` is intended for more than one party, or if the author wants to retain an encrypted copy, a single `rumor` may be wrapped multiple times, with each wrapper addressed to a different recipient.

The canonical `created_at` time belongs to the `rumor`. All other timestamps SHOULD be tweaked to thwart time-analysis attacks. Note that some relays don't serve events dated in the future, so all timestamps SHOULD be in the past.

Relays may choose not to store gift wrapped events due to them not being publicly useful. Clients MAY choose to attach a certain amount of proof-of-work to the wrapper event per NIP-13 in a bid to demonstrate that the event is not spam or a denial-of-service attack.

To protect recipient metadata, relays SHOULD only serve kind 1059 events intended for the marked recipient. When possible, clients should only send wrapped events to read relays for the recipient that implement AUTH, and refuse to serve wrapped events to non-recipients.

To reduce the ability of attackers to infer information about messages based on size, clients MAY choose to pad a wrapped message (either a `rumor` or a `seal`, but preferably a `seal`) with randomly generated data using a `padding` tag.

# An Example

Let's send a wrapped `kind 1` message between two parties asking "Are you going to the party tonight?"

- Author private key: `0beebd062ec8735f4243466049d7747ef5d6594ee838de147f8aab842b15e273`
- Recipient private key: `e108399bd8424357a710b606ae0c13166d853d327e47a6e5e038197346bdbf45`
- Ephemeral wrapper key: `4f02eac59266002db5801adc5270700ca69d5b8f761d8732fab2fbf233c90cbd`

## 1. Create an event

Create a `kind 1` event with the message, the receivers, and any other tags you want, signed by the author. Do not sign the event.

```json
{
  "kind": 1,
  "created_at": 1691518405,
  "pubkey": "611df01bfcf85c26ae65453b772d8f1dfd25c264621c0277e1fc1518686faef9",
  "content": "Are you going to the party tonight?",
  "tags": [["p", "166bf3765ebd1fc55decfe395beff2ea3b2a4e0a8946e7eb578512b555737c99"]],
  "id": "90297600a3b91c41a8a044993efb7f0b568e5944020bfee9c50ad7dae0d8c729"
}
```

## 2. Seal the rumor

Encrypt the JSON-encoded `rumor` with a conversation key derived using the author's private key and the recipient's public key. JSON-encode the resulting object and place it in the `content` field of a `kind 13` `seal` event. Sign it with the author's key.

```json
{
  "content": "{\"ciphertext\":\"f5Lfq6a9laLW9PWuYatTTnrGOSHcGJUPnb5OQ/gEEVjtDnrOzDB9VFKdUkoImEMiO6Ddu+HYn0R3hUtqgTRppOjs4zNFTLNAP/3hkN3hAaKjvUzBVYVmU1xrBS749kUhCt8v/8l/tBeen9BYB4s1luAUqdS10h8jwM+NqE8aYrv9sEU9AaLuErbI1hwq0ZUEGl5unfxHpv+QjINbrPYs1x6bGUU7D416Lp0gV6fr/wD/JLkceb/quAE2UkgzVRS4gauWL8/PyaPz3332h+vH/tMWOQd2no4sDG3ftXPO8y0zXs5p/NvcPa2hIXsOsNOPzOfCFvBk7Rfv9JjwCN0K/LztDHZOzgryELAjcm+mDWPeYBw+PYWfwayFkDbbLCsQJ1KLYRBDS7BEMBOLdd1v1vF4J196tGaN\",\"nonce\":\"s6DBwU6gq9h14+9hRwnts1qZ6BdyPgHn\",\"v\":1}",

  "tags": [],
}
```

## 3. Wrap the seal

Encrypt the JSON-encoded `kind 13` event with your ephemeral, single-use random key. JSON-encode the resulting object and place it in the `content` field of a `kind 1059`. Add a single `p` tag containing the recipient's public key. Sign the `gift wrap` using the random key generated in the previous step.

```json
{
    "content": "{\"ciphertext\":\"ta6EnLlYt2IJ+3DXZmxh55DofUbCan1lwtNB1BpU16zDqXw/j7YPSne6nx7HCDbZwAN83x7kc+GgTf89iuL6Q+i6LFcriEkHKB3EDYu/BH7O++tCXkCmi8ovN5xh5+LdD6FDYLRuO9hDzcKgDHZZNLU43ga+3m8Aij5pkDomIcjETGDkLQs0wlXF2wS05I8QYtpXBFDLae9oRS44CopMaMue8/TS/cz43CRrIlVzHKPtHaUIZ/smd3vHNV01DQpY2d/uHhhXRY5qd91b1ci9NtbzRfePl0qDkOUr9HB5Sm+XrDiWrQVWV9YeuZVSc7fR7WIG16DI40Kf1m42I7sbgoiSK12wV6G8ud+kgR+2MCRcmnSUgXQ+3wFg5Gmp7WlIclhmfklTzPcrAl20FKnlpJm3vZ/S4gSW9Viq4/Hz4dAEbh0aGt/QHn/+GyFgmwy2nVwo7GyX21j/Ji3EEkGokj6yxn+e/XeK7WcN5Jl1hFYHEP6IBfGnM+aQVzXnC24Fm5tTuyXLtcvOyahWno4wAChAntC4Q4KCRnMASEunFhtDfIH4+OTISeCZLraOZv5uWfzFl3mm3AMPCvWeGtay9QgkYyBbA9OUxJBTV8jo00TFCGO5cedtSRslv9c0zfBbEkpleEtVqYr4BswAYujwUtcF5iY8RxeB+LiouYga6H61XQ6Pec9vrGlL4jWF3ZwG2vwz9US/fN8E8y1VFNVUg+ZAc3Uh+Yq8ScPQYV9eBTW8hzRzYn5HKFgsh0OXzWpXtseIkMuyg4kWPwKxbQYJH9YuhT3eJbpdW38lVRwwRd3cB3udhDhllhs5Y105DgbowDe4J13Bg+ILRkjLwabv7PvcpptO4mwXg6SE4ZGA16pGBnAg2IzsecuyGHwnByufSxgJADUEt+y+6lz1Z2pPxmFY8FGMvDtWT2avdUM4ogRccDyqC0VduuxnKggdlqSuU855YWApC2zldd4/KzyL8WgkVUUHm6J5bclok2cRuRD8roV9f/Z4e7UvEIZEvhnr02srH64WeIN2LZPGX06oeZ0JCQ4IQBTQJ8n4t0/m49ThZ3ImCWaHJ0VTex7/7VN+rdBj8pAEKls71mm+XXtSmzzueA==\",\"nonce\":\"mFFHMKOsppp7b7KcgZ8eGqA8ojw3xSrU\",\"v\":1}",

}
```

## 4. Broadcast Selectively

Broadcast the `kind 1059` event to the recipient's relays only. Delete all the other events.

# Code Samples

## JavaScript

```javascript
import type {UnsignedEvent, Event} from "nostr-tools"
import {getPublicKey, getEventHash, getSignature} from "nostr-tools"
import {encrypt, decrypt, getSharedSecret} from "./nip44"
